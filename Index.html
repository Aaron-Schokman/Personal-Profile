       <h2><u>Personal Details</u></h2>

     </header>
     <p>My full name is Aaron Denham Romel Schokman. I am a first year at RMIT currently studying a Bachelors of Information Technology (IT). I originally moved to Australia from Sri Lanka around 6 years ago (I was 13 years old at the time). When I moved to Australia, I studied for 2 years in Westall Secondary College, and then moved to Lighthouse Christian College in Keysborough (where I currently live). I graduated from year 12 VCE last year (2021), and am currently pursuing a career in Software and Systems engineering. I enjoy gaming as a past time, I’ve been a gamer ever since I was 6 years old. While I was a gamer, I also enjoyed Basketball and Swimming, and became very successful competing against other schools and clubs and winning multiple awards and trophies along the way. </p>
     <p>My reason to pursue the IT industry is because I’ve always had a passion towards computers and what helped them run and complete such complex tasks, which was further ignited by my passion for gaming. Alongside gaming, I used to work for McDonalds during my Highschool days, but once I graduated from VCE, I worked on the maintenance team of my alma mater (Lighthouse Christian College), I only worked on the maintenance team for a few days but I gained invaluable experience in that field. Once I found another job at Premier Auto Trade (PAT) I worked there for a good three months during the Christmas break, but once university started, I am yet to find another job that could fit my schedule. So, something interesting about me could be that for someone my age (18 years old), I’ve worked in 3 different industries that has given provided me with invaluable experience and given me an insight on what it means to be an adult. And I am yet to experience what talents and skills I will learn in the IT industry. </p>

       <h2><u>Interest In I.T</u></h2>
     </header>

       <section>
        <p>My interest in IT is to be able to program and create a different perspective into the world of Technology for myself, as well as others in areas such as game design or game programming. My interest in IT began when I played my first game of Call of Duty when I was 6 years old, and as a kid I’ve always wondered how a video game was created and what the inner workings of a video game is. Supposedly that interest in how a video game runs has carried on throughout my life. At the time, most of my uncles and cousins were enthusiastic gamers too, my passion for video games came from them, but my interest of the inner workings of a video game is purely my own.</p>
         <p>The reasoning behind choosing to study IT at RMIT is because among all the other universities and tafes all across Melbourne, RMIT had the best reviews on the subjects and courses for IT and programming. Another reason for choosing RMIT over other accomplished universities is mainly because of the fact that a few of my uncles and aunties attended RMIT and are currently leading successful lives because of that. My aunty studied a Bachelors of Law. And my uncles studied a Bachelor of economics and computer science. And when I asked them if RMIT was a good university, they had nothing but great remarks about the education style and system of the university. This further compelled my decision to study at RMIT and I have been working towards it ever since high school. </p>
           <p>What I expect to learn during my studies at RMIT is that I gain knowledge and experience in areas such as programming, software design and software programming, and how those areas can contribute to the workforce. Since I have a passion for technology and computers, I would like to know all the ups and downs of technology, as well as how to fix, manage and create technology and software that can be beneficial and provide a service for today’s society, especially in the video game industry.</p>

       <h2><u>Ideal Job</u></h2>
     </header>
  <img src="SEEK JOB AD.png" alt="Figure 1:Seek Job ad for Big Ant Studios">
     <p>The position at Big Ant Studios is a gaming company that is responsible for developing some of the biggest mobile and console sports titles such as ‘Cricket 22’, ‘AO Tennis 2’, and the widely known ‘JETPACK JOYRIDE’(source: www.Bigant.com) This job position at Big Ant Studios seemed appealing to me because not only does it involve areas such as working on “cutting edge engine technology”(Ad on SEEK) it seemed like the ideal job for me to work towards because it gives me the opportunity to work with a small but collaborative team in order to fix, create and build onto current and future games.</p>
     <p>But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
     I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
     While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow me to stay within the education sector.</p>

        <li>Myers-Briggs Test</li>
        <img src="Myers-Briggs.PNG" alt="Figure 2: Myers-Briggs Personality Test Result">
<p>As shown in the results below, my Myers-Briggs test demonstrates that my personality type is ‘Adventurer’. What this means is that I mostly keep to myself, but I am not afraid to go outside my comfort zone and experience new things and challenges. What this means to me in terms of my behaviour in a team setting is that I will be very observant in group projects or activities. But I would be introverted meaning, that I wouldn’t be communicating as much as I should or. In terms of my nature, the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I make decisions based more on my emotions than thinking, which could be a positive or negative thing. Additionally, when I consider all my personality traits and attributes when forming a team, this would mean that I would need my team members to be similar in aspects such as identity(turbulent) and tactics (Prospecting) but different in nature(feeling), energy (Observant) and mind(introverted). This is because in order to work collaboratively as a team, we must share some similar attributes of some areas of our personality, and some different aspects in order to complete and tackle the task or goal.

<div id="learning">
<li>Learning Style Test</li>
<img src="Learning style test.png" alt="Figure 3: Learning Style Test Result">
<p>From a test taken to identify my learning style, the results clearly shown below demonstrate that my highest learning style tends be the ‘Reflector style’. What this means is that I am more observant and cautious. A reflector style learner also learns by gathering and concluding all their information in their own way, meaning that they look at the bigger picture. In a group or team setting, this is ideal. Mainly because one of the best learning methods for a reflector styled learner is paired discussions, feedback, coaching and demonstrations. All of these are accessible in a team setting. As for the other learning styles such as Theorist and Pragmatist (both are 22.8% of my learning style) What this information demonstrates is that I tend to think through problems in a logical and rational view, while also using it as a practice for real world scenarios. This would greatly enhance my ability to work in a team, because not only would it bring diversity and variance among my teammates, this would also mean that there is room for different perspectives and views on a goal or project. When forming a team, the team I would work best in would be people whose learning style is mainly either Theorist, Pragmatist or Activist. This is to promote and ensure that we all have different views and opinions on how we carry out or projects or goals.
</p>
<div>
<div id="psychometric">
<li>Psychomtric Test</li>
<p> The psychometric test shown below states that the areas that I scored the highest on for my psychology and how I think shows that I am Agreeable, Conscientious and rely mostly on my intellect and imagination. Another aspect of my psychological process that this test shows is that I am a very introverted person and that I have a fairly low emotional stability, which could affect my ability to work in a team setting. Agreeableness means that I am very friendly and optimistic. Conscientiousness means that I am careful and diligent. My high score in intellect/imagination translates to me being very open to experience. These factors contribute in my ability to work in a team/group setting by controlling my ability to learn and contribute valuable information to my team and increase my ability to make friends within the team. Another aspect of my psychology effecting my teamwork is that it demonstrates that I am very introverted. This could lead to me not communicate as much as I should. In terms of forming a team, unlike my other tests suggesting that a variance in personality and learning style would increase the quality and compatibility of the team. However, in terms of the psychometric test, teammates with similar scores in their psychometric test would be the best outcome for the group. Because a variance in psychometric test results among the teammates could result in clashes and disagreements.

    <h2><u>Project idea</u></h2>
  </header>
  <div id="sub">
<h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>The project idea that I have decided to tackle is facial recognition. With consideration that this may be quite challenging for a beginner to Python. To complete this project, I will be using Python and OpenCV to program the facial recognition software. What’s interesting about this project is that it can be expanded and used over multiple devices (like an app), but for the purpose of this project, I will only be demonstrating the facial recognition aspect of this software. This project stood out to me mostly because this can be implemented to many aspects in the workforce. This includes in the video game industry such as VR, if this program is improved and upgraded in the future, it could potentially be useful for government applications such as face-check to get information on an individual’s criminal history or work history, etc…
  </p>
  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>This project will be further interesting to develop because as a current beginner to Python, I would be challenged of stepping outside my comfort zone, and demonstrating my skills as a first-year programmer, and to also deepen my understanding and knowledge of Python in the process. Statistically, facial recognition at the moment is a software that the government is very diffident on the usage of facial recognition software. This is mainly due to the fact that the population, especially in the U.S. However, in upcoming years, facial recognition in the video game industry and the government, will steadily start to rise. What this means is that, if I choose to pursue this facial recognition software in the future, I will have the time to further polish, upgrade and enhance my facial recognition software, and provide it for government and video game use if the software is eligible.
  </p>
  <h3>Description of the project</h3>
    <p>This facial recognition software will require programming from Python and OpenCV. To fulfill the program and the software requirements, I will need to be familiar with Python programming (something I am currently learning). Another resource I am currently using is open-source codes I found on GitHub in order to run the program and further improve it into my own customisations and standards. To further my understanding of the program and how the software will run, I will be using other resources such as YouTube, websites and courses to further my capability and understanding to carry out the project. The purpose and aim behind creating a software like this is to potentially see it being used in the video games industry, preferably for VR. Another focus behind this project design is that the facial recognition software will inherently be used as a security and safety tool, either enforced by the government or an individual user.  For example, an extra security measure for the user’s house, or a new method to unlock your car, etc… This program runs using the OpenCV module of Python.
    </p>
    <p> The way that works is that a face(s) will be embedded into the code, then the faces will be extracted using deep learning. This process ensures that the texture, shape and other qualities on the face are recognized and remembered by the program. After the code has learned the features of the embedded face, the code will then be trained via a model to foresee any persisting errors or confusions surrounding similar facial features. After the program has passed this stage, the code will then be able to recognise faces in both an image, and a real-time video. The programming and execution of this task is something I am yet to learn and get a grasp of. With the right experience and time, this code can be expected to recognise multiple faces. This could include a program that will recognise any face that is presented to the program, given an image of the user is present on the internet (google, Facebook, Instagram). This is more valuable because the user does not have to embed their face into the code in order to be recognised. Rather, the code will scan the internet and be able to recognise the user. This aspect of the program requires a more experienced programmer. Because it uses aspects of Artificial Intelligence in the facial recognition process.   For the implementation of this project to be successful, I would have to be further educated in the OpenCV aspect of Python, as well as have a better in-depth knowledge of Python itself. Considering I lack the experience in programming Python (first year), this task will be challenging to complete, but it is definitely achievable.
    </p>
    <p>To further my knowledge in Python and OpenCV, I will have to try and understand the initial open-source codes, the structure and overall function of previous facial recognition software’s (Apple ID, Samsung, etc...). Overall, the facial recognition software development at the moment, will be limited just to my face, and my Intro to IT teachers for demonstration purposes, but it is expected to be improved in later years, as my knowledge and experience broadens.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>The tools and relevant technologies needed to accomplish this project is Python and OpenCV. OpenCV is an open-source library that is used for computer vision, machine learning and other functions such as image processing. OpenCV can be programmed using many languages such as Python, C++, Java, etc… To write this program, I will be using Python on ATOM. I will have to import the OpenCV library from an open source GitHub repository.  To fully see the capabilities of the program, the code will be run through a webcam. This will then be able to identify the faces of the embedded users (myself, and the teachers who will be grading this project later on as a demonstration). If this method does not work, another method that could suffice will include the use of Raspberry Pi to fully assemble and run the code with the assistance of a camera attached to the Raspberry Pi motherboard. The link for the open-source github repository can be found
      <a href ="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition"> here
    </a>
    </p>
    <h3> The skills required</h3>
<p>The skills required to accomplish this project, as mentioned before includes the experience and knowledge of Python programming, with regards to OpenCV. To further improve the scope and usefulness of the project, I will have to be experienced enough in Python to be able to create an AI. This AI will be paired with my facial recognition software to scan the users face and use the internet to find the details and name of the user. This method is more complicated and may take years to achieve as it involves creating an advanced AI that scans the internet (Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc…) and searches for the face represented into the facial recognition software to present results of the user such as name, Date of birth, nationality, etc.... The AI aspect of this project, is something I will have to achieve after my Bachelors of IT, when I have the required knowledge and understanding of the concepts that can be used to complete this task. So, for this course, I will only be presenting the facial recognition software at its raw state (uses embedded faces to recognise the person in the image or video)
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The overall outcome of this project is that I can fully optimise the full capacity of the facial recognition software by pairing it with artificial intelligence. With this fully functional software, I want to be able to contribute a service to the gaming industry, particularly Virtual Reality (VR) or even as added security for homes and businesses. Given the software is successful, my only goal moving forward is to keep upgrading it and improving it over the years, incorporating different and new software’s such as thermal detection, emotional cue awareness, etc…. Another aim of this project is that it is flexible enough to be upgraded and used in different industries such as retail, business, fast food, etc… This project is a viable sample to implemented to every industry because security threats such as virus’s, malware, trojan horses are all rising, so as a good added measure, and as extra security, AI controlled facial recognition seems like the next leap in global technological advancements.
